pedaalemmer
===========

## What?

Experimentation and development repository for pedestal affairs, conceptual familiarization, learning, reconnaissance, idea generation and so on.  Also contains manual/documentation resources and assets.

## Huh?

Dutch for 'pedal bin'. I had to come up with *some* name didn't I? This was the first thing that
popped up, you'd think it has something to do with the 'ped' although there are other associations
one could have made.

> Remember that the Greek ped- means "child" while the Latin ped- means "foot".

So our case, it's the latter - goodness, my instinct was correct. Better yet, I managed to
find a picture that can go with it.

## License

Just like Clojure and Pedestal, keep that in mind as I don't intend to copy paste 200 License declarations. If you feel I must because some of it is *YOUR* work and you have some unexplainable
need to tag everywhere that you made it, let me know and I'll add it whereever you want.
