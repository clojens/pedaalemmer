![The Pedal Bin and Pedestal in Copenhagen](resources/assets/images/pedestal-pedal-bin.jpg)

## What is this?

A personal repository to keep code, resources, snippets and draft texts or projects for experimentation and development in Pedestal. Conceptual familiarization, learning, reconnaissance, idea generation, those kind of things. Also will contain manual/documentation resources and assets like screenshots, notes, presentations, possible a video or two.

## The name?

Dutch for 'pedal bin'. I had to come up with *some name* didn't I? This was the first thing that popped up.

> Remember that the Greek ped- means "child" while the Latin ped- means "foot".

So in our case, it's the latter. I was lucky to intuitively realize this difference, else I might had just picked pedagog or some less acceptable derivate of such.

It also suites because, well, the trashcan / kitchensink-like nature of this repository and the content within. Somehow I even managed to find a picture that could go with it.

## License

Just like Clojure and Pedestal (see `LICENSE` file), keep that in mind as I don't intend to copy paste 200 'License Declarations'. If you feel I must because some of it is *YOUR* work and you have some unexplainable need to tag everywhere like some grafiti artist, by all means, let me know and I'll add it where ever you want.
